# Cloud Database

I am using the firestore database

It has a collection of users, which each contain a collection of the days marked

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio code, and Python.

# Useful Websites

No. Nothing was usefull. Not even the offical documentation helped. 100% painfull trial and error.

# Future Work


- Add password system
- Find cleaner way to read data
